# Task Assignments for Bert Addon Implementation
# Maps task groups from tasks.md to implementing subagents

task_assignments:
  - task_group: "Phase 1: Foundation & Configuration"
    assigned_subagent: "general-implementer"
    rationale: "Creating directory structure, configuration files, and documentation. Best handled by general implementer."

  - task_group: "Phase 2: Session Initialization System"
    assigned_subagent: "general-implementer"
    rationale: "Creating command files and documentation. No backend/frontend specific logic required."

  - task_group: "Phase 3: Task Author Command"
    assigned_subagent: "api-engineer"
    rationale: "Complex command logic with file parsing, analysis, and task generation. API engineer handles business logic well."

  - task_group: "Phase 4: Enhanced Task Numbering System"
    assigned_subagent: "api-engineer"
    rationale: "Complex algorithmic logic for smart padding and nested task support. Requires careful implementation of business rules."

  - task_group: "Phase 5: Living Document Tracking System"
    assigned_subagent: "general-implementer"
    rationale: "Creating overlay and include files with instructions. General implementation task."

  - task_group: "Phase 6: Integration Testing & Documentation"
    assigned_subagent: "testing-engineer"
    rationale: "End-to-end testing, edge case testing, and documentation validation. Perfect fit for testing engineer."
