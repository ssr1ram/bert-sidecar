# Task 03: Enhance Roadmap Detail and Clarity

## Description

After analyzing agent-os/product/roadmap.md, several sections would benefit from enhanced detail and specificity to provide clearer guidance for implementation and better tracking of progress. The roadmap is comprehensive but lacks concrete acceptance criteria, timelines, and measurable outcomes in several areas.

## Tasks

- [ ] 3.01 Add specific acceptance criteria to "In Progress" features (workflow states, taskmaps, includes)
- [ ] 3.02 Define measurable success metrics for Phase 1 completion
- [ ] 3.03 Add concrete timeline estimates for "Near-Term Features" in Q1 2025
- [ ] 3.04 Elaborate on technical architecture for "Discovery Items" to guide evaluation
- [ ] 3.05 Add specific examples for each task include type (@include/git-commit, etc.)
- [ ] 3.06 Define validation criteria for moving from Phase 1 to Phase 2
- [ ] 3.07 Add technical dependencies between phases (what must complete before what)
- [ ] 3.08 Expand "Integration Exploration" with specific prototypes to build
- [ ] 3.09 Define metrics for "50+ active users" success criterion (what counts as active?)
- [ ] 3.10 Add rollback strategies for features that don't meet validation gates

## Rationale

The roadmap provides an excellent strategic vision but lacks the tactical details needed for execution. Specific acceptance criteria help developers know when features are complete, while measurable success metrics enable progress tracking. Timeline estimates help with resource planning and stakeholder communication.

The "Discovery Items" section lists interesting features but doesn't guide how to evaluate them, making it difficult to prioritize. Adding technical dependencies prevents teams from starting Phase 2 work before Phase 1 prerequisites are met.

The "Integration Exploration" section is particularly important since the project is still determining its optimal architecture (CLI vs MCP vs slash commands). More specific prototypes would help answer this open question faster.

Finally, validation gates and rollback strategies reduce risk by ensuring each phase is truly ready before advancing and providing fallback options if features underperform.
