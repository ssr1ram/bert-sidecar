# Task 3.1.1: Define Workflow States Acceptance Criteria

## Description

Define clear, testable acceptance criteria for the task workflow states feature (draft, todo, in progress, in review, done). This will establish what functionality must be present and working for this feature to be considered complete.

## Tasks

- [ ] 3.01.1.1 Document CLI commands for state transitions
- [ ] 3.01.1.2 Define validation rules for state transitions (which states can transition to which)
- [ ] 3.01.1.3 Specify how state is persisted in task files
- [ ] 3.01.1.4 Define error handling for invalid state transitions
- [ ] 3.01.1.5 Create example test cases demonstrating all state transitions

## Rationale

The workflow states feature is core to task management. Clear acceptance criteria prevent ambiguity about what "done" means and ensure the feature is fully functional before release. Test cases validate that all transitions work correctly and edge cases are handled.
