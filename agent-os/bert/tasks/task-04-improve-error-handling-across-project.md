# Task 04: Improve Error Handling Across Project

## Description

After searching the codebase for error handling patterns, several areas could benefit from improved error handling, clearer error messages, and better recovery strategies. The search revealed references to error handling in specs, test plans, and standards documentation, indicating this is a cross-cutting concern.

## Tasks

- [ ] 4.01 Review existing error handling patterns in test plans and implementation files
- [ ] 4.02 Define standard error message format for user-facing errors
- [ ] 4.03 Add error handling to task-author command for missing files
- [ ] 4.04 Add error handling to task-create command for invalid parent numbers
- [ ] 4.05 Implement validation for frontmatter fields in config.yml
- [ ] 4.06 Create error recovery strategies for malformed task files
- [ ] 4.07 Add clear error messages for slash command failures
- [ ] 4.08 Document error handling best practices in standards
- [ ] 4.09 Add error logging for debugging purposes
- [ ] 4.10 Create test cases for all error conditions

## Rationale

Good error handling is critical for user experience. When commands fail, users need clear, actionable error messages that explain what went wrong and how to fix it. Currently, the error handling appears scattered across different components without consistent patterns.

Standardizing error messages and handling strategies will make the system more robust and easier to debug. Error recovery strategies prevent data loss when files are malformed. Comprehensive testing of error conditions ensures the system fails gracefully rather than crashing unexpectedly.

Clear documentation of error handling patterns helps maintainers follow consistent practices as the codebase grows.
