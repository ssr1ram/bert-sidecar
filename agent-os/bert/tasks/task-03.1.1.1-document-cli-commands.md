# Task 3.1.1.1: Document CLI Commands for State Transitions

## Description

Create comprehensive documentation for all CLI commands that transition tasks between workflow states. Include syntax, examples, error conditions, and best practices.

## Tasks

- [ ] 3.01.1.1.1 Document command for draft → todo transition
- [ ] 3.01.1.1.2 Document command for todo → in progress transition
- [ ] 3.01.1.1.3 Document command for in progress → in review transition
- [ ] 3.01.1.1.4 Document command for in review → done transition
- [ ] 3.01.1.1.5 Document command for backward transitions (for corrections)
- [ ] 3.01.1.1.6 Add usage examples for each command

## Rationale

Clear CLI documentation is essential for usability. Users need to understand exactly how to transition tasks between states, what flags are available, and how to handle errors. Examples help users get started quickly and reduce support burden.
