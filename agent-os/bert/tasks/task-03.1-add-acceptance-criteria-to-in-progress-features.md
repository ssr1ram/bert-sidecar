# Task 3.1: Add Acceptance Criteria to In Progress Features

## Description

Add specific, measurable acceptance criteria to the three features currently marked as "In Progress" in the roadmap: task workflow states, feature taskmaps, and task includes/primitives library. This will help developers know when these features are complete and ready for release.

## Tasks

- [ ] 3.01.1 Define acceptance criteria for task workflow states (draft, todo, in progress, in review, done)
- [ ] 3.01.2 Define acceptance criteria for feature taskmaps system
- [ ] 3.01.3 Define acceptance criteria for task includes/primitives library
- [ ] 3.01.4 Add testing requirements for each feature
- [ ] 3.01.5 Review with stakeholders and incorporate feedback

## Rationale

Without clear acceptance criteria, it's difficult to know when features are truly complete. This leads to scope creep, delayed releases, and confusion among team members about what "done" means. Clear criteria enable better planning and more predictable delivery.
